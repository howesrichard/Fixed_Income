# Time Value of Money: The Basics

## Introduction

The time value of money (TVM) is one of the most fundamental concepts in finance. It recognizes that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This principle forms the basis for virtually all financial decisions, from personal savings to corporate investment strategies.

## Present Value (PV)

The present value represents the current worth of a future sum of money, given a specified rate of return.

**Formula:**
$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}$

Where:
- PV = Present Value
- FV = Future Value
- r = Interest rate per period
- n = Number of periods

**Example:**
If you expect to receive $1,000 in 5 years and the interest rate is 5% per year, the present value would be as follows:

$PV = \frac{1,000}{(1+0.05)^5} = \frac{1,000}{1.2763} = \$783.53$

## Future Value (FV)

Future value calculates what an investment today will be worth at a future date, given a specific interest rate.

**Formula:**
$FV = PV \times (1+r)^n$

**Example:**
If you invest $1,000 today at an annual interest rate of 5% for 5 years, the future value would be:

$FV = 1,000 \times (1+0.05)^5 = 1,000 \times 1.2763 = \$1,276.30$

## Present Value of an Annuity

An annuity is a series of equal payments made at equal intervals at the end of the period.


**Formula:**
$PV_{annuity} = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}$

Where:
- PMT = Payment per period
- r = Interest rate per period
- n = Number of periods

**Example:**
The present value of $100 paid at the end of each year for 5 years, with an interest rate of 5% per year:

$PV_{annuity} = 100 \times \frac{1 - (1+0.05)^{-5}}{0.05} = 100 \times 4.3295 = \$432.95$


## Future Value of an Annuity

**Formula:**
$FV_{annuity} = PMT \times \frac{(1+r)^n - 1}{r}$

**Example:**
If you save $100 at the end of each year for 5 years, earning 5% annually:

$FV_{annuity} = 100 \times \frac{(1+0.05)^5 - 1}{0.05} = 100 \times 5.5256 = \$552.56$
