# Moody's Airline Industry Rating Methodology

## Overview

Moody's rating methodology for airlines evaluates the creditworthiness of passenger and cargo airline companies through a structured analytical framework. This methodology applies to both full-service and low-cost carriers, considering the unique characteristics and risks of the airline industry.

## Key Rating Factors

Moody's airline methodology typically focuses on four main factor categories:

1. **Scale and Business Profile** (25%)
2. **Market Position and Route Structure** (25%)
3. **Cost Structure and Profitability** (10%)
4. **Financial Policy and Financial Strength** (40%)

## Factor 1: Scale and Business Profile (25%)

### Sub-factors:
- **Size** (10%): Revenue size and fleet scale
- **Business Profile** (15%): Business model, diversification, and competitive dynamics

### Size Rating Grid

| Rating Category | Aaa | Aa | A | Baa | Ba | B | Caa |
|----------------|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| Annual Revenue (USD Billions) | ≥ $50 | $30-50 | $15-30 | $7.5-15 | $3-7.5 | $1-3 | < $1 |
| Fleet Size (# of Aircraft) | ≥ 1,000 | 700-1,000 | 400-700 | 200-400 | 100-200 | 30-100 | < 30 |

### Business Profile Considerations:

- Geographic and revenue stream diversification
- Domestic vs international exposure
- Passenger vs cargo operations
- Premium vs economy mix
- Alliance memberships and partnerships
- Vulnerability to competition
- Regulatory environment

## Factor 2: Market Position and Route Structure (25%)

### Sub-factors:
- **Market Position** (15%): Competitive strength in key markets
- **Network Strategy and Route Structure** (10%): Hub strength and network optimization

### Market Position Rating Grid

| Rating Category | Aaa | Aa | A | Baa | Ba | B | Caa |
|----------------|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| Market Share in Key Hubs | ≥ 60% | 45-60% | 35-45% | 25-35% | 15-25% | 5-15% | < 5% |
| Global Market Share | ≥ 8% | 5-8% | 3-5% | 1.5-3% | 0.5-1.5% | 0.1-0.5% | < 0.1% |

### Route Structure Considerations:
- Hub dominance and fortress hubs
- Slot-controlled airports access
- Route profitability and stability
- Network connectivity and feed
- Stage length optimization
- International route authorities

## Factor 3: Cost Structure and Profitability (10%)

### Sub-factors:
- **Cost Position** (5%): Cost per Available Seat Mile (CASM) relative to peers
- **Profitability and Margins** (5%): Historical and projected profit performance

### Cost Position Rating Grid

| Rating Category | Aaa | Aa | A | Baa | Ba | B | Caa |
|----------------|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| CASM vs Industry Average | ≥ 25% below | 15-25% below | 5-15% below | ±5% of avg | 5-15% above | 15-25% above | ≥25% above |

### Profitability Rating Grid

| Rating Category | Aaa | Aa | A | Baa | Ba | B | Caa |
|----------------|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| EBIT Margin | ≥ 17% | 14-17% | 11-14% | 8-11% | 5-8% | 2-5% | < 2% |
| EBITDA Margin | ≥ 25% | 20-25% | 16-20% | 12-16% | 8-12% | 4-8% | < 4% |

## Factor 4: Financial Policy and Financial Strength (40%)

### Sub-factors:
- **Leverage and Coverage** (20%)
- **Financial Policy** (10%)
- **Liquidity** (10%)

### Leverage and Coverage Rating Grid

| Rating Category | Aaa | Aa | A | Baa | Ba | B | Caa |
|----------------|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| Debt / EBITDA | < 0.5x | 0.5-1.5x | 1.5-2.5x | 2.5-4.0x | 4.0-6.0x | 6.0-8.0x | > 8.0x |
| EBIT / Interest | > 15.0x | 10.0-15.0x | 6.0-10.0x | 3.0-6.0x | 1.5-3.0x | 0.5-1.5x | < 0.5x |
| FFO / Debt | > 65% | 45-65% | 30-45% | 20-30% | 12-20% | 5-12% | < 5% |
| RCF / Net Debt | > 50% | 35-50% | 25-35% | 15-25% | 10-15% | 5-10% | < 5% |

*FFO = Funds From Operations, RCF = Retained Cash Flow*

### Liquidity Considerations:
- Cash as % of revenue
- Undrawn revolving credit facilities
- Free cash flow generation
- Debt maturity profile
- Access to capital markets
- Assets available for secured financing
- Aircraft order book financing requirements

### Financial Policy Considerations:
- Management's tolerance for financial leverage
- Track record of debt reduction during upcycles
- Shareholder returns vs. balance sheet strengthening
- Aircraft ownership strategy (owned vs. leased)
- Fleet age and replacement strategy
- M&A appetite and approach

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Cyclicality Adjustments
Moody's may adjust ratings based on where the industry is in its cycle:
- **Peak Cycle**: More conservative interpretation of financial metrics
- **Trough Cycle**: More favorable view of temporary metric deterioration

### Aircraft Fleet Considerations
- **Fleet Age**: Newer fleets generally viewed more favorably
- **Fleet Commonality**: Greater commonality improves operational flexibility
- **Aircraft Types**: Balanced mix of aircraft sizes for network flexibility
- **Order Book**: Evaluation of future capital commitments and flexibility

### Structural Considerations
- **Unsecured vs. Secured Debt**: Rating differentiation based on collateral
- **Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs)**: Specific notching methodology
- **Operating Leases**: Analytical adjustments to reflect lease obligations
- **Pension Obligations**: Adjustments for underfunded pension liabilities

## Event Risks

Moody's evaluates specific event risks in the airline industry:
- Fuel price volatility
- Labor relations and potential strikes
- Terrorism and security concerns
- Public health crises and pandemic impacts
- Severe weather and natural disasters
- Regulatory changes and environmental compliance costs
- M&A activity and consolidation

## Rating Notching Considerations

Moody's may notch ratings up or down based on:
- Government ownership and support prospects
- Parent/subsidiary relationships
- Structural subordination
- Asset quality and collateral value
- Recovery prospects in default scenarios
