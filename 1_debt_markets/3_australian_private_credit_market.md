## Introduction

The Australian private credit market has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade, evolving from a relatively niche segment to become a vital component of Australia's broader financial ecosystem. As of 2024, the market is valued at approximately AU$205 billion, demonstrating its significant expansion and increasing importance within Australia's financial landscape. This document provides a comprehensive examination of Australia's private credit market, exploring its structure, key players, recent transactions, and emerging trends.

## Market Structure and Growth

Private credit refers to debt financing provided outside traditional banking channels, typically through direct lending arrangements between institutional investors and borrowers. This market has seen tremendous growth in Australia, driven by:

1. **Regulatory constraints on traditional bank lending**: Following the Global Financial Crisis and subsequent regulatory reforms, Australian banks have become more selective in their lending activities, creating opportunities for alternative lenders.

2. **Institutional investor demand for yield**: In a low-interest-rate environment, Australian superannuation funds, insurance companies, and asset managers have increasingly allocated capital to private credit strategies in search of higher returns.

3. **Borrower preferences for flexible financing solutions**: Many Australian businesses, particularly those in the middle market, appreciate the customized financing solutions and greater flexibility offered by private credit providers.

4. **Global expansion of private credit platforms**: Major international private credit managers have established or expanded their presence in Australia, bringing expertise and capital to the market.

According to data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and other financial institutions, private credit in Australia has grown from approximately $33 billion in 2016 to $205 billion in 2024, representing a more than six-fold increase in just eight years.

## Financial Sponsors and Leveraged Buyouts

Financial sponsors, primarily private equity firms, have emerged as significant drivers of Australia's private credit market, particularly through leveraged buyout (LBO) transactions:

### Private Equity as a Catalyst for Private Credit Growth

Private equity firms in Australia, such as BGH Capital, Pacific Equity Partners, Quadrant Private Equity, Adamantem Capital, and global firms including KKR, Blackstone, TPG, and EQT, have accelerated the growth of private credit through their acquisition financing needs. 

Financial sponsors typically rely on debt to finance a significant portion of their acquisitions. In a traditional LBO structure, the private equity firm contributes 30-40% of the purchase price as equity, with the remainder financed through various forms of debt. This debt is secured against the assets and future cash flows of the acquired company.

### LBO Financing Evolution in Australia

The financing structure for Australian LBOs has evolved significantly:

1. **Pre-GFC (Before 2008)**: Dominated by bank-syndicated loans with relatively high leverage multiples.
