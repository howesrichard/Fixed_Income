# Australian Fixed Income Market: Main Instruments

## Introduction

The Australian fixed income market encompasses a diverse range of debt securities and instruments that provide investors with regular income streams and capital preservation opportunities. This document outlines the main fixed income instruments in the Australian market, examining their characteristics, issuers, and roles within the broader financial system.

## Government Securities

### Treasury Bonds (TBs)

Treasury Bonds are medium to long-term debt securities issued by the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) on behalf of the Australian Government. Key characteristics include:

- Medium to long-term maturities (typically 2-30 years)
- Fixed interest rate (coupon) paid semi-annually
- Face value repaid at maturity
- Highly liquid with active secondary market trading
- Benchmark securities for pricing other fixed income instruments
- Zero default risk (backed by the Australian Government)

Treasury Bonds serve as a cornerstone of the Australian fixed income market and are used to finance government operations and infrastructure.

### Treasury Indexed Bonds (TIBs)

Treasury Indexed Bonds are medium to long-term securities whose capital value is adjusted for movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), offering protection against inflation. Features include:

- Principal indexed to inflation (CPI)
- Fixed real interest rate paid quarterly on the adjusted capital value
- Inflation-adjusted principal repaid at maturity
- Lower coupon rates than conventional Treasury Bonds
- Protection against unexpected inflation
- Typically longer maturities (5-30 years)

TIBs are particularly valuable for investors seeking to maintain purchasing power over long investment horizons.

### Treasury Notes

Treasury Notes are short-term discount securities issued by the AOFM to help manage the Australian Government's within-year financing requirements. Characteristics include:

- Short maturities (less than 12 months)
- Issued at a discount to face value (zero coupon)
- Full face value paid at maturity
- No regular interest payments
- Used for government cash flow management
- Highly liquid with low credit risk

Treasury Notes play a crucial role in the AOFM's portfolio for managing seasonal fluctuations in government cash flows.

## Semi-Government Securities

### State Government Bonds

These are bonds issued by state government borrowing authorities such as:

- New South Wales Treasury Corporation (TCorp)
- Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV)
- Queensland Treasury Corporation (QTC)
- Western Australian Treasury Corporation (WATC)
- South Australian Government Financing Authority (SAFA)
- Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation (Tascorp)
- Northern Territory Treasury Corporation (NTTC)

Characteristics include:

- Medium to long-term maturities
- Fixed or floating interest rates paid semi-annually
- Higher yields than Commonwealth Government Securities
- Used to fund state infrastructure and operations
- Strong credit ratings (typically AA to AAA)
- Important segment of the Australian fixed income market

The semi-government bond market has grown significantly in recent years, particularly to fund increased infrastructure investment at the state level.

## Corporate Debt Securities

### Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by corporations to raise capital for various business purposes. Key features include:

- Fixed or floating interest rates
- Various maturities (typically 1-10 years)
- Higher yields than government bonds (reflecting greater risk)
- May be secured or unsecured
- Credit ratings that vary by issuer (from investment grade to high yield)
- Less liquid than government securities

The Australian corporate bond market has historically been smaller compared to other developed economies but has been growing steadily.

### Covered Bonds

Covered bonds are debt securities issued by financial institutions that are backed by a pool of assets (typically residential mortgages) that remain on the issuer's balance sheet. Characteristics include:

- Dual recourse structure (to both the issuer and the cover pool)
- Higher credit ratings than unsecured bank debt
- Lower yields than equivalent unsecured bonds
- Regulated under the Banking Act 1959
- Subject to cover pool asset quality requirements
- Maximum issuance limited to 8% of an issuer's Australian assets

Covered bonds provide a more secure funding option for banks and are particularly attractive to risk-averse investors.

## Money Market Instruments

### Bank Bills

Bank bills (also known as bank accepted bills) are short-term discount securities accepted or endorsed by banks. Features include:

- Short maturities (usually 30-180 days)
- Sold at a discount to face value
- No periodic interest payments
- Return derived from the difference between purchase price and face value
- Important benchmark rate (Bank Bill Swap Rate or BBSW)
- Used for short-term corporate funding

Bank bills remain a significant component of the Australian money market despite declining volumes in recent years.

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

Certificates of Deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, representing a bank's promise to pay a fixed sum with interest. Key characteristics include:

- Short maturities (typically 30 days to 5 years)
- Fixed or floating interest rates
- Negotiable in the secondary market
- Higher yields than government securities
- Important funding tool for banks
- Subject to the Financial Claims Scheme guarantees (up to $250,000 per depositor)

CDs provide banks with a flexible funding instrument while offering investors a low-risk, short-term investment option.

### Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs)

NCDs are a type of CD that can be traded in the secondary market before maturity. They are used extensively by financial institutions for liquidity management and as a funding source.

## Structured Securities

### Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS)

RMBS are securities backed by a pool of residential mortgages, where payments from the underlying mortgage loans are passed through to investors. Features include:

- Structured into different tranches with varying risk-return profiles
- Floating rate interest payments (typically linked to BBSW)
- Complex credit enhancement mechanisms
- Sequential payment structures
- Ratings ranging from AAA to unrated (depending on the tranche)
- Important funding channel for both major banks and non-bank lenders

The Australian RMBS market is well-established and has demonstrated resilience through various economic cycles.

### Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)

ABS are securities backed by non-mortgage assets such as auto loans, credit card receivables, equipment leases, and other receivables. Characteristics include:

- Backed by diversified asset pools
- Typically shorter maturities than RMBS
- Various credit enhancement mechanisms
- Floating rate interest payments
- Different risk-return profiles across tranches
- Smaller market than RMBS in Australia

ABS provide investors with exposure to specific asset classes and offer issuers an alternative funding source.

### Covered Bonds

As mentioned above under Corporate Debt Securities, covered bonds are a type of structured security with specific regulatory oversight and balance sheet treatment.

## Supranational, Sovereign and Agency (SSA) Bonds

These are bonds issued by international organizations, foreign governments, and their agencies in the Australian dollar market. Notable issuers include:

- World Bank
- Asian Development Bank

Characteristics include:

- Strong credit ratings (typically AAA)

SSA issuers are attracted to the Australian market by its deep liquidity, stable economic conditions, and diverse investor base.
