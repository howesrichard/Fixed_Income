| Class C (Non-conforming) | BBB | 400-500 |
| Class D (Non-conforming) | BB | 600-750 |

### Spread Evolution

RMBS spreads have experienced some volatility in 2024:

- Spreads tightened in early 2024 on strong investor demand
- Mid-year widening occurred amid broader market volatility and interest rate uncertainty
- Recent stabilization as markets adjusted to economic conditions
- Senior AAA tranches have shown the most stability, while mezzanine and junior tranches experienced greater volatility

## Performance Metrics

### Delinquency and Default Rates

Mortgage performance in Australian RMBS pools has shown resilience despite economic challenges:

- 30+ day arrears across prime RMBS pools increased modestly to 1.45% as of Q3 2024, up from 1.20% in late 2023
- Non-conforming RMBS pools show higher but still manageable delinquency rates of approximately 3.2-3.5%
- Regional variations are significant, with Queensland and Western Australia showing higher delinquency rates than New South Wales and Victoria
- The proportion of loans in severe arrears (90+ days) remains relatively low at approximately 0.65% for prime pools

According to S&P Global Ratings' SPIN index (which covers both capital market and non-capital market issuance):

- Overall arrears rates reached 4.23% in the June 2024 quarter, up from 4.01% in March
- This level is approaching but still below pandemic-era peaks
- Strong new issuance activity continues to dilute the SPIN index, potentially masking some underlying pressure on debt serviceability

### Loss Experience

Actual losses in Australian RMBS have remained very low by global standards:

- Cumulative losses on prime RMBS pools have typically remained below 0.25% of the initial pool balance
- Non-conforming RMBS has experienced slightly higher losses, but still typically below 1.0% cumulatively
- Strong house price appreciation in many regions has limited loss severity when defaults do occur
- Lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) provides additional protection on many loans with higher LTV ratios

### Rating Agency Actions

Rating agencies have generally maintained stable outlooks on Australian RMBS in 2024:

#### Moody's
- Maintained stable outlooks for most prime RMBS tranches
- Issued cautionary reports about increasing mortgage delinquencies
- Projected moderate increases in delinquency rates in coming quarters due to cost-of-living pressures and interest rate impacts

#### S&P Global Ratings
- Conducted several rating affirmations across various RMBS programs
- Limited rating upgrades, primarily for seasoned transactions with significant credit enhancement build-up
- Few downgrades, typically isolated to specific tranches with identified performance concerns
- Noted that while rising interest rates and cost-of-living pressures are credit negative, they haven't materially affected asset performance to date

#### Fitch Ratings
- Published the Dinkum RMBS Index showing steady performance with modest deterioration
- Upgraded several senior and mezzanine tranches of seasoned transactions due to structural deleveraging
- Maintained stable outlooks on most rated transactions

## Rating Agency Methodologies for RMBS

Rating agencies employ sophisticated methodologies to assess the credit quality of Australian RMBS transactions. These methodologies incorporate quantitative models, qualitative analysis, and stress testing to determine appropriate ratings for different tranches within a securitization structure.

### Key Components of Rating Methodologies

#### 1. Collateral Analysis

Rating agencies conduct detailed analysis of the underlying mortgage pool:

- **Loan Characteristics**: Analysis of loan-to-value ratios (LVRs), borrower credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, loan seasoning, loan purpose (owner-occupied vs. investment), loan terms, and interest rate types (fixed vs. variable)
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Geographic distribution, property type concentration, borrower concentration, and employment sector diversification
- **Historical Performance**: Originator track record, historical delinquency and default rates, prepayment patterns, and loss severities
- **Documentation Level**: Full-doc vs. alt-doc or low-doc loans and verification procedures
- **Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)**: Coverage levels and financial strength of LMI providers

#### 2. Quantitative Modeling

Agencies apply proprietary models to project loan performance under various stress scenarios:

- **Default Probability Models**: Statistical models that predict the likelihood of default based on loan and borrower characteristics
- **Loss Severity Models**: Estimate the expected loss given default, incorporating property value declines, foreclosure timelines, and recovery expenses
- **Cash Flow Modeling**: Detailed modeling of the transaction's cash flows under various stress scenarios, including interest rate movements, prepayment rates, default timing, and recovery assumptions
- **Stress Testing**: Application of multiples to base-case default assumptions to simulate severe economic downturns
- **Interest Rate Stresses**: Evaluation of the impact of rising, falling, and volatile interest rate environments on both borrower performance and structural protections

#### 3. Structural Analysis

Detailed assessment of the transaction's structural features:

- **Credit Enhancement**: Subordination levels, excess spread, reserve funds, and overcollateralization
- **Payment Structure**: Sequential vs. pro-rata payment mechanisms, principal allocation, interest allocation, and performance triggers
- **Liquidity Support**: Liquidity facilities, principal draws, and reserve funds to cover temporary shortfalls
- **Hedging Arrangements**: Interest rate swaps, basis swaps, and currency swaps (for offshore issuance)
- **Trigger Mechanisms**: Performance-based triggers that alter payment priorities or increase credit enhancement
- **Call Options**: Cleanup calls and step-up margins that incentivize redemption at specific points

#### 4. Operational Risk Assessment

Evaluation of key transaction parties:

- **Originator Quality**: Underwriting standards, approval processes, and historical performance
- **Servicer Capabilities**: Collection procedures, arrears management, loss mitigation strategies, and operational robustness
- **Trustee and Manager Roles**: Governance structure, independence, and oversight mechanisms
- **Counterparty Risk**: Financial strength and replacement provisions for swap providers, liquidity facilities, and account banks

### Agency-Specific Approaches

While all major rating agencies follow similar principles, there are nuances in their methodologies:

#### S&P Global Ratings
- Employs the LEVELS model to estimate default frequency based on Australian-specific parameters
- Uses the Advance model for cash flow analysis with Australia-specific housing market assumptions
- Applies a "AAA" stress scenario representing a severe recession approximately 30% more severe than the early 1990s Australian housing downturn
- Calibrates rating stresses to align with global benchmarks while accounting for Australian market specifics

#### S&P's AAA Stress Scenario in Detail

S&P Global Ratings' AAA stress scenario for Australian RMBS represents an extremely severe economic downturn designed to test the resilience of the highest-rated tranches. The scenario incorporates multiple stress factors calibrated to a level of severity commensurate with a AAA rating:

**House Price Correction Assumptions:**

- **Base-Case Market Value Decline (MVD)**: S&P typically applies a base-case MVD of approximately 30% for the archetypical Australian mortgage pool
- **AAA Rating Stress MVD**: At the AAA rating level, S&P applies significantly more severe MVD assumptions, typically in the range of 40-45% nationally
- **Regional Variations**: Higher MVD assumptions for regions with greater historical volatility or current overvaluation:
  - Sydney and Melbourne: MVDs can reach 45-50% in AAA scenarios due to higher historical price volatility and perceived overvaluation
  - Mining-dependent regions (e.g., parts of Western Australia and Queensland): Can see MVDs of 50-55% due to economic concentration risk
  - Regional and rural areas: Generally 40-45% MVDs, but can be higher for areas with less economic diversification

- **Property Type Adjustments**: Additional MVD adjustments based on property characteristics:
  - High-density apartments: Additional 5-10% MVD stress due to perceived higher market risk and potential oversupply
  - Luxury properties: Additional 5-10% MVD stress due to thinner markets and greater price volatility
  - Investment properties: Additional 2-5% MVD stress compared to owner-occupied properties

- **Timing Assumptions**: The AAA stress scenario typically assumes:
  - A rapid initial price decline (approximately 25-30% in the first year)
  - A more moderate continued decline over subsequent years
  - A prolonged recovery period with no meaningful price appreciation for several years
  - Total peak-to-trough decline realized over approximately 2-3 years

- **Historical Calibration**: S&P's AAA MVD assumptions for Australia are approximately:
  - 30% more severe than the early 1990s housing downturn (which saw national price declines of around 20%)
  - More severe than any historical housing market correction in Australia's modern economic history
  - Designed to withstand a "once-in-a-century" economic shock

**Unemployment Shock Components:**

S&P's AAA stress scenario incorporates severe unemployment assumptions that significantly exceed historical peaks:

- **Unemployment Rate Assumptions**:
  - Base-case unemployment rate (as of 2024): Approximately 4-5%
  - AAA stress scenario unemployment rate: Rapid increase to 11-12%
  - This represents an increase of approximately 6-8 percentage points from current levels
  - Peak unemployment is typically assumed to remain elevated for an extended period (18-24 months) before gradual improvement

- **Employment Sector Stress**:
  - Disproportionate job losses in cyclical industries (construction, retail, discretionary services)
  - Significant stress in financial services employment
  - Widespread impact across both blue-collar and white-collar professions
  - Regional employment shocks, particularly in areas with less economic diversification

- **Income Reduction Assumptions**:
  - Beyond the unemployment shock, S&P assumes income reductions for employed borrowers
  - Typical income reduction of 10-15% for employed borrowers through reduced work hours, lost bonuses, or salary reductions
  - Self-employed borrowers facing more severe income disruption (25-30% income reduction)

- **Duration and Recovery**:
  - Unemployment assumed to remain elevated for an extended period
  - Gradual recovery over 3-5 years to return to pre-stress levels
  - Permanent income impairment for some borrower segments

**Combined Impact and Default Modeling:**

The combination of house price declines and unemployment shocks feeds into S&P's default frequency and loss severity models:

- **Weighted Average Foreclosure Frequency (WAFF)**:
  - Base-case foreclosure frequency for prime pools: Approximately 1.1-1.5%
  - AAA stress scenario foreclosure frequency: Typically 10-15% for prime pools
  - Higher foreclosure frequencies for non-conforming pools: 15-25% in AAA scenarios
  - These represent multiples of 8-12x the base-case foreclosure rates

- **Loss Severity Integration**:
  - The severe MVD assumptions directly impact loss severity calculations
  - Typical AAA loss severity assumption: 40-50% of the outstanding loan balance
  - Combined with the foreclosure frequency, this produces lifetime loss expectations of 4-7.5% for prime pools in AAA stress scenarios
  - For non-conforming pools, lifetime loss expectations in AAA scenarios can reach 7.5-12.5%

- **Regional Variations**:
  - Higher default frequencies assumed for regions with concentrated economic activity
  - Correlation factors applied to capture the relationship between regional unemployment and housing market stress

**Interest Rate Stress Components:**

The AAA scenario also incorporates significant interest rate stress:

- **Interest Rate Movements**:
  - Significant upward shock in interest rates (300-400 basis points) to test payment shock on variable rate loans
  - Alternative downward interest rate scenarios to test impact on excess spread in the structure
  - Combinations of rising and falling rates to identify the most stressful scenario for each transaction

- **Prepayment Stress**:
  - Severe reductions in voluntary prepayments (down to 0-5% CPR) reflecting reduced refinancing opportunities
  - Testing of prepayment spikes in certain scenarios to assess impact on structural features

**Transaction Structural Implications:**

To achieve AAA ratings, Australian RMBS transactions typically require:

- Credit enhancement levels of 10-20% for prime transactions (higher for non-conforming)
- Robust liquidity support mechanisms to withstand prolonged stress periods
- Conservative sequential payment structures, especially in early years
- Performance triggers that rapidly trap excess spread or accelerate repayment of senior notes in deteriorating conditions
- Strong operational risk mitigants, including backup servicing arrangements

This comprehensive AAA stress scenario demonstrates the extreme resilience required for Australian RMBS tranches to achieve the highest rating category, representing a level of stress far beyond any historical experience in the Australian mortgage market.

#### Moody's
- Utilizes the MILAN (Moody's Individual Loan Analysis) framework adapted for Australian mortgage characteristics
- Applies a two-step approach: first determining expected losses, then stress-testing to determine credit enhancement required for each rating level
- Places significant emphasis on originator quality and servicer stability in the qualitative assessment
- Incorporates specific adjustment factors for regional concentration risks within Australia

#### Fitch Ratings
- Applies its ResiGlobal model with Australian-specific calibration for default probabilities
- Uses a probability of default/loss severity approach focused on "rating through the cycle"
- Places strong emphasis on loan affordability metrics and borrower debt-to-income levels
- Considers market value decline (MVD) assumptions based on historical Australian housing market corrections

### Australian Market Specificities

Rating agencies adapt their global methodologies to account for unique features of the Australian mortgage and housing markets:

- **Full Recourse Lending**: Australian mortgages are full recourse to borrowers, unlike some other markets
- **Lenders Mortgage Insurance**: Extensive use of LMI for high-LVR lending
- **Variable Rate Prevalence**: Higher proportion of variable rate loans compared to some international markets
- **Regional Housing Markets**: Different dynamics across state markets requiring regional adjustment factors
- **Regulatory Framework**: Strong prudential oversight by APRA and consumer protection through ASIC
- **Banking Concentration**: Dominated by a small number of major banks with strong credit profiles
- **Non-Bank Sector**: Growing importance of non-bank originators with different funding and operational models

### Recent Methodology Updates

Rating agencies continuously refine their approaches based on market developments:

- Greater focus on borrower affordability metrics given rising interest rates
- Enhanced analysis of non-bank originator business models and funding stability
- Updated assumptions regarding mortgage payment holidays and hardship arrangements post-pandemic
- Refined geographic concentration risk assessments reflecting changing regional economic disparities
- Increased scrutiny of alternative documentation loans in light of economic uncertainties

## Market Innovations and Trends

- Evolving ASIC regulations around responsible lending continue to influence origination practices
- International regulations, including SEC rules affecting U.S. investors in Australian RMBS
- The Australian Government's housing affordability initiatives impacting the underlying mortgage market

## Prime vs. Non-Conforming Mortgages

The Australian RMBS market encompasses securities backed by different types of residential mortgages, primarily categorized as "prime" and "non-conforming." Understanding these distinctions is crucial for investors and market participants.

### Prime Mortgages

Prime mortgages represent the highest quality residential loans in the Australian market with the following characteristics:

- **Borrower Quality**: High credit quality borrowers with strong credit scores, stable employment history, and consistent income documentation
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)**: Typically lower LVRs, generally below 80% (loans above 80% LVR usually require Lenders Mortgage Insurance)
- **Serviceability**: Strong debt-to-income ratios meeting standard bank criteria
- **Documentation**: Full documentation of income, assets, and liabilities
- **Repayment History**: Clean repayment history with no significant delinquencies
- **Property Type**: Standard residential properties in established areas
- **Origination**: Primarily originated by major banks and larger regional lenders, though non-bank lenders also originate prime loans
- **Compliance**: Fully comply with APRA's prudential standards (for bank originators) and ASIC's responsible lending obligations

Prime RMBS transactions feature:
- Lower credit enhancement requirements
- Tighter pricing (lower spreads)
- Higher ratings on senior tranches (often AAA from multiple agencies)
- Broader investor appeal, including international investors

### Non-Conforming Mortgages

Non-conforming mortgages do not meet all the standard criteria for prime loans but still represent viable lending opportunities with appropriate risk management:

- **Borrower Quality**: Borrowers with less-than-perfect credit histories, including those with past credit events such as defaults or bankruptcies that have been discharged
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: Often higher LVRs, sometimes up to 95% (with LMI) or even higher in specialized cases
- **Serviceability**: May use alternative methods to assess serviceability, including less stringent debt-to-income requirements
- **Documentation**: May include "alt-doc" or "low-doc" loans where self-employed borrowers provide alternative income verification
- **Repayment History**: May include borrowers with previous minor delinquencies or other credit impairments
- **Property Type**: Can include non-standard properties or locations
- **Origination**: Primarily originated by specialized non-bank lenders focused on specific borrower segments
- **Specialized Segments**: Often targets specific borrower categories such as self-employed, recent immigrants, or those with irregular income patterns

Non-conforming RMBS transactions feature:
- Higher credit enhancement requirements
- Wider pricing (higher spreads)
- Potentially lower ratings on senior tranches
- More specialized investor base with expertise in credit assessment

### The Spectrum of Mortgage Quality

In practice, there is a spectrum of mortgage quality in the Australian market:

1. **Super-Prime**: Highest quality borrowers with exceptionally strong credit metrics
2. **Prime**: Standard high-quality mortgages meeting all traditional lending criteria
3. **Near-Prime**: Slightly outside traditional prime criteria but still relatively strong credit
4. **Non-Conforming**: Doesn't meet standard bank criteria but still demonstrates acceptable credit risk
5. **Sub-Prime**: Significant credit impairments (a much smaller segment in Australia compared to markets like the US)

### Performance Differences

Historical performance data shows:
- Prime mortgages typically experience 30+ day delinquency rates of 1-2% in normal economic conditions
- Non-conforming mortgages typically see delinquency rates 2-3 times higher than prime pools
- Loss severities tend to be higher in non-conforming pools due to higher original LVRs
- Both categories have demonstrated resilience during economic stress, though with different degrees of deterioration

### Structural Implications for RMBS

These differences translate to distinct RMBS structural features:
- Higher subordination levels for non-conforming RMBS
- More rapid amortization triggers in non-conforming structures
- Often more extensive liquidity support mechanisms
- Different excess spread capture mechanisms
- More conservative servicing arrangements

### Market Evolution

The distinction between prime and non-conforming has evolved over time:
- Post-GFC regulatory changes have tightened lending standards across the board
- The non-conforming segment has moved toward higher quality within its category
- New specialized lending niches have emerged (e.g., SMSF lending, expat loans)
- Technology and data analytics have improved risk assessment across all categories

## Investor Base

The investor base for Australian RMBS has evolved in recent years:

### Domestic Investors
- Australian banks (for liquid asset requirements)
- Superannuation funds
- Asset managers
- Insurance companies
- High-net-worth individuals (primarily through managed funds)

### International Investors
- Asian banks and sovereign wealth funds
- European asset managers
- North American insurance companies and pension funds
- Specialized structured credit funds

The investor mix typically varies by tranche:
- Senior AAA tranches attract the broadest investor base, including international participants
- Mezzanine tranches are often placed with specialized credit funds and Australian institutions
- Junior tranches frequently retained by originators or placed with credit-focused hedge funds

## Market Outlook

The outlook for the Australian RMBS market in 2025 and beyond is shaped by several factors:

### Positive Factors
- Strong structural features and historical performance attracting investors
- Relative value compared to other fixed income asset classes
- Continued need for funding diversification by issuers
- Regulatory capital advantages for certain issuers

### Challenges
- Persistent economic uncertainties and interest rate pressures
