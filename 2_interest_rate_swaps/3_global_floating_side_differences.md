# Interest Rate Swap Markets: Australia, US, and Europe Comparison

## Introduction
Interest rate swaps (IRS) are derivative contracts where two parties exchange interest rate cash flows, typically fixed versus floating, based on a notional principal amount. This document compares the key structural differences between the Australian, US, and European interest rate swap markets.

## Key Market Differences

### Reference Rates
- **Australia**: Primarily uses BBSW (Bank Bill Swap Rate), which is a collection of rates at which banks will lend to each other
- **US**: Transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities
- **Europe**: Uses both €STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) which has replaced EONIA, and EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) which continues to be widely used

### Risk-Free Rate Transition
- **Australia**: Transition to AONIA (Australian Overnight Index Average) in progress but less advanced than US/Europe
- **US**: SOFR transition largely complete following LIBOR cessation
- **Europe**: €STR transition in progress with EURIBOR continuing alongside

### Regulatory Environment
- **Australia**: Regulated by ASIC and RBA
- **US**: Regulated by CFTC, SEC, and Federal Reserve
- **Europe**: Regulated by ESMA and national regulators under EU frameworks

### Market Conventions
- **Australia**: Tends to follow UK conventions with local adaptations
- **US**: Has developed its own distinctive market practices
- **Europe**: More fragmented historically but increasingly standardized under EU regulations

## Conclusion
While these markets share fundamental similarities in swap structure, they differ significantly in reference rates, conventions, and market practices. These differences reflect the unique development paths of each market and their respective regulatory environments.
