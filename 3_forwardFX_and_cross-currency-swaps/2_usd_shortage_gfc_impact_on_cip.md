# The USD Shortage During the GFC and Its Impact on CIP

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) created a severe USD shortage that wasn't resolved through traditional interest rate mechanisms. This phenomenon significantly impacted Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP) through several interconnected institutional and market constraints.

## The Anatomy of the USD Shortage

### 1. Global Banking System's Structural USD Dependence

Prior to the GFC, non-US banks had dramatically expanded their USD assets. European banks alone had accumulated approximately $8 trillion in USD-denominated assets by 2007. These institutions relied on three main funding sources:

- Wholesale short-term USD funding markets (commercial paper, repo)
- USD deposits from U.S. money market funds
- FX swaps where they borrowed USD against their domestic currencies

This created a significant currency mismatch on their balance sheets that required constant refinancing.

### 2. Sudden Funding Market Freeze

When the crisis hit, several critical USD funding channels simultaneously collapsed:

- The asset-backed commercial paper market contracted by over $400 billion in just a few months
- U.S. money market funds withdrew approximately $500 billion from foreign banks after Lehman's collapse
- Interbank lending markets effectively shut down as measured by the LIBOR-OIS spread widening to over 350 basis points

Non-US banks suddenly needed to find alternative sources of USD funding to maintain their USD-denominated assets and meet obligations.

## Why Traditional Price Mechanisms Failed

### 1. Balance Sheet Constraints vs. Price Incentives

The critical constraint wasn't price but counterparty risk and balance sheet capacity:

- Banks became unwilling to lend to each other at any price due to uncertainty about counterparty solvency
- US banks with access to USD funding faced regulatory and internal risk limits on interbank lending
- Financial institutions hit internal risk limits and stopped providing liquidity to the market regardless of potential profits

As BIS research has shown, when balance sheet constraints bind, traditional price mechanisms become ineffective - arbitrageurs couldn't deploy capital even when outsized profit opportunities existed.

### 2. Funding Liquidity vs. Market Liquidity Spiral

A negative feedback loop developed:

- As funding liquidity deteriorated, institutions were forced to sell USD assets
- Forced selling depressed asset prices and increased volatility
- Lower collateral values and higher volatility further restricted access to secured funding
- This worsened funding conditions despite higher interest rates being offered

This "liquidity spiral" described by Brunnermeier and Pedersen meant that higher USD interest rates couldn't solve the problem because the constraint wasn't the price of money but access to money.

## Impact on CIP Specifically

### 1. FX Swap Market as Last Resort

As traditional funding markets closed, non-US institutions desperately turned to FX swap markets as the "funding source of last resort," creating extraordinary demand for USD through swaps. This led to:

- A massive imbalance in the supply-demand dynamic for USD via FX swaps
- The cost of obtaining USD through FX swaps (the basis) disconnected from interest rate differentials
- The cross-currency basis for AUD/USD widened to -50 to -60 basis points

### 2. Institutional Limitations on Arbitrage

Several factors prevented market participants from exploiting and thereby correcting these CIP deviations:

#### a) Quarter-End and Year-End Regulatory Reporting
- Banks faced capital surcharges for being designated as Globally Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)
- This created strong incentives to reduce balance sheet size around reporting dates
- Arbitrage trades that would normally correct CIP deviations were avoided because they expanded balance sheets

#### b) Cash-Futures Basis Arbitrage Limits
- The arbitrage required to correct CIP deviations involves simultaneously:
  * Borrowing in one currency
  * Lending in another
  * Executing FX swaps to hedge currency risk
- Each step consumed scarce balance sheet capacity and risk limits

#### c) Central Bank Facilities Limitations
- Initial central bank swap lines were insufficient in size and scope
- The Fed's initial swap lines in December 2007 only covered the ECB and SNB
- It wasn't until October 2008 that the Fed removed caps on swaps with major central banks
- The RBA received a swap line relatively late in the crisis progression

## The Australian Dimension

For Australia specifically, several factors exacerbated the CIP deviation:

1. **Classification as a "Risk Currency"**: During flight-to-quality episodes, the AUD is typically classified as a "risk currency" and experiences selling pressure

2. **Banking System's Offshore Funding Reliance**: Australian banks relied heavily on offshore wholesale funding, with approximately 25-30% of major banks' funding coming from foreign sources

3. **Commodity Price Collapse**: As commodity prices fell sharply during the GFC, this added additional pressure on the AUD

4. **Limited Initial Access to Fed Swap Lines**: The RBA did not initially have access to Fed swap lines, which were first established with the ECB and SNB

The CIP deviations persisted because the shortage wasn't simply about the price of USD (which would indeed be solved by higher interest rates in normal conditions), but about the severe constraints on financial institutions' ability to move capital across markets. The normal arbitrage mechanisms that would maintain CIP were effectively broken due to institutional constraints, counterparty fears, and balance sheet limitations.
