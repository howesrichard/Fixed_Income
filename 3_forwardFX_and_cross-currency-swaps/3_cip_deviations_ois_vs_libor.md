# CIP Deviations Using OIS vs. LIBOR Rates

Using Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rates rather than LIBOR for measuring Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP) deviations does indeed reduce the magnitude of the deviations significantly, but notable deviations still persist, especially during crisis periods.

## Key Differences in CIP Measurement: OIS vs. LIBOR

### LIBOR-Based CIP Deviations

During the GFC (2008-2009):
- AUD/USD LIBOR-based basis: approximately -50 to -60 basis points
- EUR/USD LIBOR-based basis: approximately -100 basis points 
- USD/JPY LIBOR-based basis: approximately -80 basis points

### OIS-Based CIP Deviations

During the same period:
- AUD/USD OIS-based basis: approximately -25 to -35 basis points
- EUR/USD OIS-based basis: approximately -70 basis points
- USD/JPY OIS-based basis: approximately -60 basis points

The differences were even more apparent during the COVID-19 crisis (March 2020), with LIBOR-based measures showing significantly wider deviations than OIS-based measures.

## Reasons for the Differences

### 1. Credit Risk Component

LIBOR includes a significant bank credit risk premium, especially during crises:
- During the GFC, the LIBOR-OIS spread itself reached over 350 basis points
- This credit risk component distorts pure funding cost comparisons

OIS rates better reflect the "risk-free" component of interest rates:
- Based on overnight central bank rates with minimal credit risk
- Closer to the theoretical benchmark for pure interest rate parity

### 2. Term Risk Premium

LIBOR contains a term premium (lending for 3 months vs. overnight):
- This creates an additional premium that varies across currencies
- During stress periods, term premiums can diverge significantly between currencies

### 3. Bank-Specific Factors

LIBOR was based on a panel of banks with different characteristics:
- Composition of LIBOR panels varied across currencies
- Different credit qualities of panel banks across currencies added noise

## Post-Crisis Evidence

Research by the BIS (Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan, 2018) found that:

1. OIS-based CIP deviations were approximately 30-40% smaller than LIBOR-based measurements
2. However, significant OIS-based CIP deviations still persisted, especially:
   - At quarter-ends and year-ends
   - During regulatory reporting periods
   - During financial stress episodes

For the Australian dollar specifically, studies from the RBA showed that:
- AUD/USD OIS-based CIP deviations averaged around -15 basis points from 2010-2019
- This compared to LIBOR-based deviations averaging -30 basis points over the same period

## Implications

The persistence of CIP deviations even when measured with OIS rates provides strong evidence that:

1. Balance sheet constraints and regulatory factors were the primary drivers of CIP deviations, not simply credit risk concerns

2. The fundamental market structure and institutional constraints discussed earlier (balance sheet costs, regulatory reporting requirements, etc.) created real limits to arbitrage beyond credit risk considerations

3. While part of the LIBOR-based CIP deviations represented credit risk differentials rather than pure funding costs, a significant portion represented true market inefficiencies

The transition away from LIBOR toward overnight risk-free rates (SOFR in the US, AONIA in Australia) has made the OIS-based measure the standard for analyzing CIP deviations in current research, providing a cleaner picture of funding market dislocations.
