# Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity Since 2008

Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP) violations have become significantly more pronounced since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Below are notable examples with their institutional drivers.

## Major CIP Deviation Episodes

### 2008-2009 Financial Crisis
During the height of the crisis, the EUR/USD cross-currency basis swap spread reached approximately -100 basis points. This means that borrowing in USD through the FX swap market was effectively 1% more expensive annually than borrowing directly in USD money markets.

### European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2011-2012)
The EUR/USD basis widened to around -60 to -80 basis points as European banks struggled with funding pressures.

### 2016 Money Market Fund Reform
Following US money market reforms, the USD/JPY basis widened to nearly -70 basis points, and USD/EUR reached -50 basis points.

### Year-End Effects (2016-present)
Quarter-end and especially year-end "window dressing" by banks has led to recurring spikes in the basis. For example, at year-end 2018, the USD/JPY 3-month basis reached approximately -90 basis points.

### COVID-19 Crisis (March 2020)
During the market panic, the EUR/USD basis widened to about -80 basis points, while the USD/JPY basis reached nearly -140 basis points before central bank swap lines eased conditions.

## Institutional Factors Driving CIP Deviations

### 1. Banking Regulation

#### Basel III Capital Requirements
Higher capital requirements increased the balance sheet cost for banks to engage in arbitrage activities. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) in particular treats low-risk activities like FX swaps similarly to higher-risk activities, making arbitrage less attractive.

#### Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
Banks now must maintain sufficient high-quality liquid assets, reducing their willingness to provide short-term wholesale funding, especially in USD.

### 2. Central Bank Divergence

#### Quantitative Easing (QE) Asymmetry
Uncoordinated QE programs created imbalances in global liquidity. When the Federal Reserve implemented QE while other central banks were on different policy paths, this created persistent one-way demand for currency hedging.

#### Negative Interest Rate Policies
The ECB, BOJ, and SNB adopting negative rates while the Fed maintained positive rates amplified hedging demand from institutions in negative-rate jurisdictions seeking USD yields.

### 3. Market Structural Changes

#### Reduced Dealer Intermediation
Post-crisis, primary dealers reduced market-making capacity by approximately 80% in some fixed-income and FX markets, limiting arbitrage activities.

#### Money Market Fund Reform (2016)
US reforms reduced prime money market funds' AUM by over $1 trillion, limiting a key source of short-term USD funding for non-US banks.

### 4. Global Imbalances in USD Demand

#### Structural USD Funding Gap
Non-US institutions, particularly Japanese and European banks and institutional investors, developed a structural need for USD funding that exceeded $10-12 trillion globally.

#### Corporate Hedging Activity
After 2014, many non-US corporates increased USD debt issuance to take advantage of low rates, but needed to swap back to local currencies, creating persistent hedging pressure.

### 5. Central Bank Actions

#### Fed Tapering and Tightening Cycles
The Fed's policy normalization after QE created USD scarcity while other major central banks maintained accommodative policies.

#### Repatriation Effects
US tax reform in 2017 encouraged US multinationals to repatriate overseas USD holdings, reducing offshore USD liquidity.

The persistence of these deviations challenges fundamental market theories and demonstrates that institutional constraints and regulations can create lasting market inefficiencies even in highly liquid global currency markets.
